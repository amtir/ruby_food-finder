"Food Finder Project"

Hired as a consultant, I came across some ruby code calling various APIs and different libraries. My work/tasks encompassed, fixing bugs, optimizing, and refactoring. This tiny small project written from scratch, called "Food Finder" allowed  me to review and practice ruby coding at my own pace. 

Concepts acquired, reenforced and reviewed : 

ADT Data Structures (Classes, Hashes, Array, String, Symbols, Ranges, ...)
File I/O / String manipulations
Object Programming OOP, methods overriding, ...
Inheritance, multiple inheritance with mixins
Modules (name spacing with mixins)
Handling Exceptions/Errors

Ak.
