#Ruby coding : "Food Finder Project"

###*Hired as a consultant, I had to optimize and refactor some ruby code calling various APIs and different libraries. This small project called "Food Finder" written from scratch, allowed  me to review and practice ruby coding at my own pace.* 

###Concepts acquired and reviewed : 

* ADT Data Structures (Classes, Hashes, Symbols, Ranges, ...)
* File I/O / String manipulations
* Object Programming OOP, methods overriding, ...
* Inheritance, multiple inheritance with mixins
* Modules (name spacing with mixins)
* Handling Exceptions/Errors
