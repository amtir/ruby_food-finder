#Ruby coding : "Food Finder Project"

###*Hired as a consultant, I came across some ruby code calling various APIs and different libraries, that I had to optimize, and refactore. This small project called "Food Finder" written from scratch, allowed  me to review and practice ruby coding at my own pace.* 

###Concepts acquired, reenforced and reviewed : 

* ADT Data Structures (Classes, Hashes, Symbols, Ranges, ...)
* File I/O / String manipulations
* Object Programming OOP, methods overriding, ...
* Inheritance, multiple inheritance with mixins
* Modules (name spacing with mixins)
* Handling Exceptions/Errors
